### Current Focus
The current work is focused on the **priority** implementation. This feature will be added to the main `stm.ino` file later.

### File Descriptions
* `esp32-webserver-i2c.ino`: The main code for the ESP32 webserver with I2C.
* `stm.ino`: The primary, stable code for the STM32 (currently without priority).
* `priority_test.ino` / `priortest.ino` / `stm-v2.ino`: Experimental version of the STM32 code that includes priority logic for testing.

### Archive
The `Archive/UART` contains old codes with UART instead of I2C
